The following evaluation infrastructure needs definition:
1. **Test Dataset Creation:** Sample municipality projects with known correct funding matches
2. **Success Metrics:** Definition of "successful" funding program match (precision, relevance criteria)
3. **Acceptance Threshold:** Required accuracy level for POC approval
4. **Feedback Loop:** Process for collecting and incorporating validation feedback
