# Email to Miguel - Meeting Request

**Subject:** Meeting Request - Ways of Working Discussion

---

Hi Miguel,

I'd like to schedule a quick 30-minute face-to-face meeting to establish our team agreements as we're starting this collaboration.

**Why this meeting:**
At the beginning of any partnership, it's valuable to align on how we'll work together. We both have a vested interest in making this successful - you need effective product development, and I have financial stake through revenue share. Let's establish the basics: communication structure, feedback approach, and how we stay aligned on priorities.

**What I'd like to cover:**
- Collaboration structure (check-in cadence, communication preferences, feedback loops)
- Business context sharing (leads, pipeline, priorities) so product decisions align
- Brief onboarding to get on the same page about goals and direction

I've put together a simple one-pager with a proposed approach that I'll bring to the meeting. This aligns with our retainer agreement (Section 1.2 on coordination meetings and strategic participation).

**When works for you?** I'm flexible - just need 30 minutes that fits your schedule.

Looking forward to it.

Best,
Marius
