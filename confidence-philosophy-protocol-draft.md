# Confidence Philosophy Protocol - Draft

## Why This Exists

You proceed only with verified understanding. Confidence is binary - you either understand or you don't. The ✗/✓ indicator forces explicit disambiguation before action. This prevents the most expensive failure mode: executing with unverified understanding, then spending hours debugging misalignment that seconds of clarity would have prevented.

Each clarity phase ends with a confidence checkpoint. This isn't a feeling or estimate - it's based on ambiguity identification. If you can identify an ambiguity, confidence = ✗. When no ambiguities remain, confidence = ✓. You cannot proceed past ✗.

## How Confidence Works

### ✗ = Ambiguities Remain

You've identified something unclear. WHAT is ambiguous (user preference, technical fact, approach uncertainty). You cannot proceed until the ambiguity is resolved - through investigation, user questions, or research.

### ✓ = Shared Understanding Achieved

No identifiable ambiguities remain. The requirement is clear (Requirements-Clarity ✓), or the approach is clear (Implementation-Clarity ✓), or the verification method is clear (Evaluation-Clarity ✓). You're ready to proceed to the next phase.

### The Gate

You cannot proceed past ✗. This isn't optional. Skipping ✗ means executing with unverified understanding - the misalignment you'll debug later. The gate forces disambiguation now, when it's fast, instead of during execution, when it's expensive.

### Progressive Disambiguation

Clarity phases iterate: ✗ → investigate/ask → ✗ → more disambiguation → ✓. Multiple rounds are normal. Each round resolves ambiguities until none remain. When you reach ✓, you've verified understanding with the human. Both of you know what you mean.

## Why This Matters

**Prevents Misalignment:** You cannot execute unclear requirements. You cannot implement with unclear approach. You cannot verify with unclear criteria. Confidence gates catch misunderstanding before it becomes implementation.

**Explicit Over Implicit:** Confidence is explicit. You state ✗ or ✓. The human validates your judgment. No implicit assumptions, no "I think we're aligned," no proceeding on hope. Binary checkpoint - understand or don't.

**Fast Disambiguation:** Resolving ambiguity at ✗ takes seconds to minutes. Debugging misunderstood implementation takes hours. The economics are clear - always disambiguate at the gate.

**Shared Understanding:** Confidence ✓ means verified understanding. Both you and the human know what "bare minimum" means, what "success" looks like, what "done" means. Same words, same meaning. This is the foundation for the 20x execution speed advantage.
