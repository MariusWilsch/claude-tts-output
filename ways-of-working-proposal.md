# Ways of Working - Product Development Partnership

**Purpose:** Establish communication structure and expectations for effective collaboration between Marius (Product Development Lead) and ARCHIBUS team.

**Context:** This proposal aligns with our Retainer Services Agreement (Section 1.2 - "weekly coordination meetings" and "participate in commercial/strategic topics") and reflects my financial stake in the business via subscription revenue share.

## 1. Meeting Structure

### Weekly 1:1s with Miguel (CEO)

## 4. Onboarding Session (One-Time)

**Purpose:** Establish baseline context for operating as product development lead

**Topics to Cover:**
- Business goals and product strategy
- Customer needs and target market
- Current sales pipeline and commercial priorities
- Decision-making boundaries (what I can decide autonomously vs. needs approval)
- Success metrics (how do we measure if this partnership is working?)

**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Timing:** As soon as feasible to establish foundation for ongoing collaboration

## 5. Success Indicators

This communication structure is working if:
- Deliverables align with business priorities (not working in isolation)
- Clear feedback loop exists (I know if work is helpful or needs adjustment)
- Strategic context informs product decisions (understanding customer needs, pipeline)
- Feeling integrated as product development lead (not external consultant)

**Next Steps:**
1. Miguel reviews this proposal
2. Schedule onboarding session
3. Establish weekly 1:1 cadence
4. Confirm all-hands meeting inclusion
