# Ways of Working

**Purpose:** Establish communication structure for effective collaboration between Marius and the ARCHIBUS team.

**Context:** This aligns with our Retainer Services Agreement (Section 1.2 - "weekly coordination meetings" and "participate in commercial/strategic topics") and reflects Marius's financial stake via subscription revenue share.

## 1. Meeting Structure

### Weekly 1:1s with Miguel (CEO)
**Frequency:** Weekly or biweekly (30 minutes)

**Purpose:**
- Strategic alignment on product priorities and business goals
- Business context: client leads, sales pipeline, subscription growth, customer feedback
- Feedback on recent deliverables (e.g., load testing analysis)
- Commercial/product decision discussions (pricing, roadmap)
- Unblocking and resource needs

### Weekly Technical Sync with Ryan (API Developer)
**Status:** Already established ✓

**Purpose:**
- API integration work

### All-Hands Meeting Inclusion
**Purpose:**
- Team integration

### As-Needed Coordination with Erki (System Admin)

## 2. Communication Preferences

**Primary Channel:** WhatsApp for day-to-day communication and updates

**Deliverable Storage:** Microsoft Teams for all documentation, analysis, and work products

---

## 3. Deliverable Review Process

**What Marius Commits To:**
- Clear documentation with executive summary
- Work products stored in Teams
- Deliverables aligned with agreed priorities

**What ARCHIBUS Team Commits To:**
- Review within 1 week of submission
- Feedback with direction: specific guidance on what's working and what needs adjustment (e.g., "Good on X, adjust Y")
- This allows Marius to act accordingly and iterate effectively

**Why This Matters:** Feedback loop ensures work stays aligned with business needs and prevents working in isolation.

## 4. Onboarding Session (One-Time)

**Purpose:** Establish baseline context for effective collaboration

**Topics to Cover:**
