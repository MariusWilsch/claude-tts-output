# Test TTS Integration

This is a test of the Claude Code text-to-speech integration using GitHub Pages and Speechify.

## Section 1: Introduction

The goal of this integration is to enable Claude Code to generate text that can be easily read aloud using the Speechify browser extension. This eliminates the manual work of copying and pasting content.

## Section 2: How It Works

1. Claude generates markdown content
2. Content is written directly to the repository
3. Git commit and push triggers GitHub Pages rebuild
4. URL is returned to the user
5. User opens URL in browser with Speechify extension
6. Speechify reads the content aloud

## Section 3: Benefits

- **Automation**: No manual copy-paste required
- **Efficiency**: Direct workflow from generation to playback
- **Accessibility**: Content is immediately available via URL
- **Reusability**: Designed for use across multiple commands

## Conclusion

This test verifies that the complete workflow functions correctly. If you're hearing this read aloud by Speechify, the integration is working!
