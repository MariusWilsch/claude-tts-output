## Section 2: Goal Determination

### Must (POC Scope)
- Website with landing page for Klimafolgenschutzverein targeting municipalities
- Interactive questionnaire to capture project details (type, scope, budget, municipality info)
- AI-powered semantic search of funding databases (Förderdatenbank, KfW, BAFA, EU sources)
- Display of relevant funding programs with estimated amounts and percentages
- Package-based categorization for standardized projects (digitalization, climate protection, infrastructure)
- Lead generation flow directing to association membership application
- Data capture for follow-up consultation

### Deferred (Post-POC)
- Document upload capability (cost estimates, planning documents from architects)
- Direct funding application submission through platform interface
- Browser automation for filling external funding forms
- Detailed personalized consultation and advisory services
- Integration with EE-Mann (energy efficiency expert) workflow

### Out of Scope
- Custom/niche project types beyond defined standard packages
- On-site consultation visits (replaced by remote/online approach)
- Manual processing of individual edge cases
- Physical distribution materials or regional office setup
