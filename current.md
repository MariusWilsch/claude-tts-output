# Second Test - Checking Rendering

This is another test to verify the GitHub Pages rendering behavior.

## Update Time

Current timestamp: 2025-11-14 13:17:00

## Content

This markdown file does NOT have YAML front matter. We're testing whether GitHub Pages will render it as HTML or serve it as raw markdown.

## What We're Learning

- Does Jekyll require explicit YAML front matter?
- Can we rely on automatic processing?
- Or do we need to prepend `---` blocks ourselves?
