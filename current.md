## Section 2: Goal Determination

### Must (POC Scope)
- Website with landing page for Klimafolgenschutzverein targeting municipalities
- Interactive questionnaire to capture project details (type, scope, budget, municipality info)
- AI-powered semantic search of funding databases (Förderdatenbank, KfW, BAFA, EU sources)
- Display of relevant funding programs with estimated amounts and percentages
- Package-based categorization for standardized projects (digitalization, climate protection, infrastructure)
- Lead generation flow directing to association membership application
- Data capture for follow-up consultation

### Deferred (Post-POC)
- Document upload capability (cost estimates, planning documents from architects)
- Direct funding application submission through platform interface
- Browser automation for filling external funding forms
- Detailed personalized consultation and advisory services
- Integration with EE-Mann (energy efficiency expert) workflow

### Out of Scope
- Custom/niche project types beyond defined standard packages
- On-site consultation visits (replaced by remote/online approach)
- Manual processing of individual edge cases
- Physical distribution materials or regional office setup

### Outstanding Requirements Definition

**Items Requiring Workshop 2 Clarification:**

**Website Scope (MEDIUM Priority):**
- Number of pages and site structure
- Branding assets (logo, colors, style guide)
- Content/copywriting responsibility and approval process
- Design complexity level and reference examples
- Municipality targeting messaging and positioning

**Questionnaire Structure (HIGH Priority):**
- Exact questions and field types (dropdown, text, number)
- Conditional logic and branching rules
- Number of steps/screens in user flow
- Validation requirements and error handling
- Client explicitly stated: "we need to define together"

**Package Categorization (HIGH Priority):**
- Definition criteria (budget ranges, municipality size, employee count)
- Total number of packages to support
- Differentiation fields per package type
- Example packages with concrete specifications
- Currently only conceptual - no detailed specifications provided

**Funding Database Integration (MEDIUM Priority):**
- Integration sequence (all sources at once vs phased approach)
- API availability vs web scraping requirements
- Data freshness and update frequency needs
- Which funding sources are MVP-critical vs nice-to-have

**Lead Data Capture (LOW Priority):**
- Specific form fields required (municipality name, contact, project details)
- Essential vs optional data points
- Storage mechanism and follow-up workflow integration
