# New Test Without YAML Front Matter

This content was written WITHOUT the YAML front matter block at the top. Let's see if the workflow needs to add it automatically.

## Testing Autonomous YAML Handling

If this renders as HTML at the `.html` URL, it means Jekyll is processing it even without explicit YAML front matter.

If it shows as raw markdown, we need to ensure YAML front matter is always prepended when writing new content.

## Expected Behavior

The utility script should handle adding YAML front matter automatically when new content is written, ensuring every update triggers Jekyll processing.
